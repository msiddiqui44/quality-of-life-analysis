# Quality of Life Dataset Analysis

This project investigates how economic and environmental factors shape quality of life across countries.  
It explores correlations between safety, cost of living, pollution, commute time, and healthcare quality using global data from Numbeo.

The project includes a full R-based analysis, visualizations, and an online slideshow presentation.

## Key Questions Explored

1. Do countries with lower safety tend to have lower costs of living?
2. How do commute times affect pollution across continents?
3. Does higher purchasing power lead to better access to quality healthcare?
